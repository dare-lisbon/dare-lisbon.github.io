We are pleased to announce the Third ACM Europe Summer School on Distributed and Replicated Environments (DARE 2025).
DARE is aimed at master's students and PhD students interested in the field of distributed systems and programming languages.

In this edition, we focus on techniques for supporting mixed consistency systems. The school combines theory and practice. Through lectures by active researchers in the field, students will get acquainted with state-of-the-art techniques and the latest research advances. Moreover, in hands-on sessions, students can also develop and experiment with existing frameworks.
The prospective topics to be covered in this edition include:

- Introduction to strong consistency and highly available systems
- Designing and implementing replicated data types
- Programming models for distributed systems and applications
- Verification techniques to ensure adequate consistency
- Testing and debugging distributed systems
- Byzantine fault-tolerance


DARE is a summer school organized within the Erasmus+ Blended Intensive Programme funded by the European Union. It consists of a one-week course. These in-person sessions are combined with online introductory and closing sessions.

After the in-person week, the Summer School will have a closing session in late September 2025. The evaluation consists of a small research project determined during the in-person week which needs to be orally defended during the closing session.

Upon successfully completing the DARE Summer School, NOVA University Lisbon will issue a transcript of records for 3 ECTS. Students participating under the Erasmus+ programme can receive recognition of the 3 ECTS according to the conditions outlined in their learning agreement. Self-funded participants can verify recognition options with their home university.
