## Registration

We are aiming to gather a group of maximum 30 motivated and enthusiastic master's or PhD students with a background in computer science and distributed systems.

Participants need to fill in an application form – the link on the right. We will select participants based on the screening of a motivation statement, transcripts, and curriculum vitae. Accepted participants will be invited to join and register for the Summer School.

Accepted participants eligible for an Erasmus+ grant will need to then register their mobility via a dedicated Erasmus+ mobility site. The rest of the participants will directly receive a link to the payment site. There is no application fee.

### How much does it cost?
Students awarded with an Erasmus+ grant do not need to pay a registration fee (only accommodation if opted in).

Students from partner universities are eligible for an Erasmus+ mobility grant to cover their expenses, this explicitly includes NOVA University of Lisbon, and University of Porto, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, but also check with your local university if they have – or are willing to enter – an Erasmus+ BIP agreement with TU Darmstadt.

For Students without an Erasmus+ grant: Thanks to our sponsors, we are able to offer the summer school itself free of charge.

We have pre-reserved hotel rooms that cost 353,25€ per room, (so 177€ per person when sharing the 2-person hotel rooms).




## Venue

DARE 2024 will be hosted by the [Technical University Darmstadt, Germany](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/).

Darmstadt is easy to reach via plane, travel to Frankfurt Airpoprt (FRA) and then take the [Airliner](https://www.heagmobibus.de/de/airliner) to Darmstadt Luisenplatz (this is a direct connection from the Airport to the city center).

Alternatively, Darmstadt is also well-connected via train, often via Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof then connecting to Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof.
