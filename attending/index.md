## Registration

We are aiming to gather a group of maximum 30 motivated and enthusiastic master's or PhD students with a background in computer science and distributed systems.

Participants need to fill in an application form – the link on the right. We will select participants based on the screening of a motivation statement, transcripts, and curriculum vitae. Accepted participants will be invited to join and register for the Summer School.

Accepted participants eligible for an Erasmus+ grant will need to then register their mobility via a dedicated Erasmus+ mobility site. The rest of the participants will directly receive a link to the payment site. There is no application fee.
