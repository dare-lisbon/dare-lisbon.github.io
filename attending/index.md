## Registration

We are aiming to gather a group of maximum 30 motivated and enthusiastic master's or PhD students with a background in computer science and distributed systems.

Participants need to fill in an application form – the link on the right. We will select participants based on the screening of a motivation statement, transcripts, and curriculum vitae. Accepted participants will be invited to join and register for the Summer School.

Accepted participants eligible for an Erasmus+ grant will need to then register their mobility via a dedicated Erasmus+ mobility site. The rest of the participants will directly receive a link to the payment site. There is no application fee.

### How much does it cost?
Students awarded with an Erasmus+ grant do not need to pay a registration fee (only accommodation if opted in).

Students from partner universities are eligible for an Erasmus+ mobility grant to cover their expenses, this explicitly includes Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Technische Universität Darmstadt, and University of Kaiserslautern-Landau, but also check with your local university if they have – or are willing to enter – an Erasmus+ BIP agreement with NOVA University Lisbon.

For Students without an Erasmus+ grant: Thanks to our sponsors, we are able to offer the summer school itself free of charge.

We have setteing pre-reserved hotel rooms and prices will be available soon.




## Venue
