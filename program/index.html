DARE 2025 focuses on techniques for supporting highly available distributed systems. 
The school combines theory and practice. 
Through lectures by active researchers in the field, 
students will get acquainted with state-of-the-art techniques and the latest research advances. 
Moreover, in hands-on sessions, students can also develop and experiment with existing frameworks.


The prospective topics to be covered in this edition include:

* Introduction to highly available distributed systems
* Designing and implementing replicated data types
* Verification techniques for highly available systems
* Broadcast algorithms
* Testing and debugging distributed systems
* Programming models for replicated distributed systems
* Byzantine fault-tolerance
  
A more detailed program will become available at a later stage.
