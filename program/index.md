DARE 2025 focuses on techniques for supporting highly available distributed systems. 
The school combines theory and practice. 
Through lectures by active researchers in the field, 
students will get acquainted with state-of-the-art techniques and the latest research advances. 
Moreover, in hands-on sessions, students can also develop and experiment with existing frameworks.

### Lecturers and Topics

**Nuno Preguiça - The Quest for “Optimal” Conflict Resolution**
In this lecture we focus on the problem of conflict resolution in the context of data management systems. We overview different contexts in which conflict resolution is a key issue, from groupware to geo-replicated and local-first systems, and discuss the requirements and techniques used, from simple last-writer-wins registers to CRDTs.

**Ragnar Mogk - Protocol RDTs: Programs as Replicated Data**
Protocol RDTs extend the concept of replicated data types by treating programs—not just data—as the replicated entity. This approach captures both state and behaviour, enabling systems to enforce application-level correctness under weak consistency. The talk presents the foundations of Protocol RDTs and demonstrates how they enable expressive, coordination-free distributed programming.

**José Orlando Pereira - Highly Available Analytical Processing**
State-of-the-art analytical processing relies on advanced query optimisation and parallelism across processors and clusters. Meanwhile, geo-distributed and local-first systems achieve high availability by encapsulating eventual consistency in replicated data types. However, these approaches are difficult to combine, limiting analytical performance on highly available data. This talk offers a hands-on introduction to analytical processing and Conflict-free Replicated Data Views as a solution for enabling high-performance analytics under high availability.
